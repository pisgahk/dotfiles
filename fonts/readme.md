## No Italic font support.

Primarily this font was created as a hybrid of Iosevka and some of the good things that I love about Jetbrains Mono.
If you have come this far, you can tell that it is only meant for coding scenarios.
Italics do not look good to me in coding spaces, I prefer Light fonts with monostyled colourthemes to distinguish various parts of my codebase.

> Intentionally, I have neglected italic fonts within this font.

The only font styles that are available for this are the Normal and **Bold** font styles.
If _Italics_ is what you were looking for from this font, I'm sorry to disappoint you.
